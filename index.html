He just believes in satisfaction, oh, oh
He cut your heart and left it open, now you're all in

Give me warmth, and I will let you ignite
We'll walk the streets on fire and fill it with lights
No, I don't want to be pretentious, you're a goddess
I sound a little bit ridiculous, but I'm honest

So, move your body close to mineLet me dive into your ocean of emotions
Let me crawl into your senses, love
Give you truth and my devotion, slow motion
Feel your body as I lay you down

You've been talking to the last guy, uh
He's been asking you one last time
If he could try to mend and fix your broken heart, uh
Read back pages that you've torn apart
But all he gave you was destruction, desolation
He just believes in satisfaction, oh, oh
He cut your heart and left it open, now you're all in
And I don't want you as an option, girl, no

I was lying to myself lately
Denying the truth of how you just make me feel

Waiting for you to come around and be my lover
Give me warmth, and I will let you ignite
We'll walk the streets on fire and fill it with lights
No, I don't want to be pretentious, you're a goddess
I sound a little bit ridiculous, but I'm honest
